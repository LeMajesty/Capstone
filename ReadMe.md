Who's  is that Pokemon? The Url is deployed as a localhost:3000 on the webpage browser.
The website implements zodiac signs, personailty traits (positive/negative), and hobbies to find the pokemon that you're most likely a match with.
The features I chose to place in the project was allowing the user to create their own posts, delete them, like, and to love posts from other users. The webpage should give the user as sense of using Twitter, because that's what I picked as a main template for the project.
